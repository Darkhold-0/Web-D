React : JS library for building user interfaces (UI)

=> React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

=> React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM, and so creating a reusable component-based library is primary.

=> React is all about components. (component based architecture)
    : component : reusable piece of code that performs a specific task.
    : component is function in react.
   // ( like custom HTML element ) [for understanding only]

=> React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to efficiently update the browser.
=> React is declarative - we tell React what we want to see on the screen.
=> React is efficient - React can efficiently update the browser as and when data changes.

React vs Angular vs Vue 

=> Angular is a framework for building user interfaces and React is a library for building user interfaces.
=> Angular is a full-fledged framework that provides a lot of features out of the box, while React is a library that only provides the basic features and leaves the rest up to the developer.

Why REACT
    : reusability
    : fast
    : Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY)
    : Readability
    : maintainability
    : Separation of Concerns (SoC)
    : Virtual DOM

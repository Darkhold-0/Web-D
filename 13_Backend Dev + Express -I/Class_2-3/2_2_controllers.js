// CONTROLLERS

controllers are components responsible for handling incoming requests from clients, processing the requests, and returning appropriate responses. They act as intermediaries between the client's request and the application's data/model layer, orchestrating the flow of data and logic within the application.

---------------------------------
Here's a breakdown of the responsibilities of controllers:

1=> Request Handling: Controllers receive incoming HTTP requests from clients. They extract relevant data from the request (such as parameters, headers, and request body) to determine the action to be taken.

2=> Business Logic: Controllers contain the business logic necessary to fulfill the client's request. This logic may include validating input data, interacting with the application's data layer (e.g., querying the database), performing necessary calculations or operations, and orchestrating interactions between different parts of the application.

3=> Data Manipulation: Controllers manipulate data as required by the application's use cases. This may involve creating, reading, updating, or deleting records in the database, processing data, transforming data into a suitable format for the response, and so on.

4=> Response Generation: After processing the request and executing the necessary logic, controllers generate an appropriate response to send back to the client. This response typically includes an HTTP status code, headers (e.g., Content-Type), and a body containing the data or information requested by the client.

5=> Routing: In many web frameworks, controllers are associated with specific routes or endpoints in the application. They define how different URLs map to controller actions, ensuring that requests are routed to the correct controller method for processing.
